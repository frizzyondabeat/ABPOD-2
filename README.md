# ABPOD-2
The project consists of constructing an autonomous self-driving shuttle by incorporating the Udacity Self-Driving Car technology and effectively controlling the ABPOD-2. The repository for this project will undergo continuous updates as the performance of both the ABPOD-2 and the simulation model improves.
